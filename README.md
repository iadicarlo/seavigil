# SeaVigil

**A near-real-time, explainable, open-source monitor for illegal-fishing behaviors - with a reason, an authorization check, and an auditable evidence dossier for every flag.**

Live: **https://iadicarlo.github.io/seavigil** - a worldwide showcase, a near-real-time `?live` monitor, and an [alerts feed](https://iadicarlo.github.io/seavigil/alerts.html).

SeaVigil flags vessels that show seemingly illegal behavior and, for each one, answers the questions a monitoring platform usually leaves open: *why* was it flagged, *is the vessel authorized* to be there, and *can the record be audited*. It runs as a static site (no server, no cloud account) and the whole pipeline is open source.

It does not try to out-detect [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org) (GFW) or reinvent dark-vessel detection; it builds on and consumes their open data. The wedge is the last mile: **per-flag explanation + authorization grading + auditable evidence + near-real-time alerts + offline deployment**, all open.

---

## The five behaviors it flags

| Behavior | How | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Apparent fishing in an MPA | RandomForest + SHAP attribution (our model) | GFW labeled AIS (Kroodsma 2018) |
| Dark vessel (SAR) in an EEZ / reserve | consumed, not recomputed | GFW Sentinel-1 (Paolo 2024) |
| AIS spoofing (impossible movement) | our detector | NOAA AIS + live aisstream |
| Going dark (AIS disabling) | consumed | GFW gaps (Welch 2022) |
| At-sea encounter (transshipment) | consumed | GFW encounters (Miller 2018) |

Every flag is tagged with the EEZ it falls in (global Marine Regions boundaries) and graded for **authorization**: a foreign-flagged vessel is looked up in the GFW vessel-identity registry and checked against the RFMO / regional authorizations on record (FFA, WCPFC, IOTC, ICCAT, IATTC, CCSBT, CCAMLR), so a bare "foreign" becomes *authorized / authorization lapsed / no authorization on record / domestic*. National EEZ licences are not public, so an empty record means "no public record", not proof.

## Three ways to see it

- **Showcase** (the homepage): an illustrative 584 records across 132 EEZs and 59 flag states, on real WDPA + EEZ boundaries.
- **Near-real-time monitor** (`?live`): the GFW Events API (gaps + encounters, about a 3-4 day lag) plus live AIS spoofing, filtered to the high-signal subset (a foreign or unauthorized vessel inside another state's EEZ, or a no-take incursion), refreshed hourly by a GitHub Action.
- **Alerts** ([alerts.html](https://iadicarlo.github.io/seavigil/alerts.html) + an [RSS feed](https://iadicarlo.github.io/seavigil/alerts.xml)): new high-severity leads, each carrying its flag, EEZ, authorization status, and reason.

The interface is available in **English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese**, and the site loads **zero external resources** (every library, font, glyph, and the basemap are vendored locally), so it runs fully offline.

## Why it is not a GFW clone

Detecting apparent fishing from vessel tracks is a solved, industrialised problem - GFW's flagship product. Even MPA-incursion alerting is shipped: **Skylight** (Allen Institute for AI) does it free for 70+ countries. SeaVigil reinvents neither. What no one ships together is:

- a **per-flag explanation** - a SHAP attribution for *why a position scored as fishing*, and an explicit rule/evidence trail for the other behaviors;
- an **authorization grade** - "foreign" checked against real RFMO records, not just flag-vs-coast;
- an **auditable dossier** - a SHA-256 integrity hash over the incident's canonical facts plus full data provenance, downloadable as JSON;
- **near-real-time alerts that carry all of the above**; and
- **offline, open-source deployment** - it runs on a laptop with no account, and the whole pipeline is public.

> **Honest scope.** A SeaVigil flag is an *inspection lead*, not courtroom proof. Encrypted VMS outranks public AIS/SAR in fisheries law, and remote-sensing-only prosecutions are rare. SeaVigil tells an officer where to look and why; it does not convict.

## Compared to other tools

| Tool | Alerts | Per-flag explanation | Authorization grade | Offline / open |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Skylight (Allen Institute) | free, 70+ countries | no | no | no (vetted account) |
| Starboard | paid | no | partial | no |
| OceanMind | managed service | no (human analysts) | yes (analysts) | no |
| Global Fishing Watch | data / portal | no | registry data | no (cloud / API) |
| **SeaVigil** | RSS + page, with reasons | **SHAP + rules** | **RFMO records** | **laptop, open source** |

## How it works

```
AIS / SAR / GFW events ─▶ behavior detection ─▶ per-flag reason (SHAP or rule)
                                  │
        global EEZ + WDPA ──▶ jurisdiction tag ──▶ foreign?
                                  │
        GFW vessel registry ─▶ authorization grade (authorized / lapsed / none)
                                  │
                                  ▼
          auditable dossier (who · where · when · why · authorization ·
                             SHA-256 integrity hash · data provenance)
```

- **Detection.** A `scikit-learn` RandomForest scores fishing-vs-not per AIS position from interpretable movement features, evaluated on a **vessel-grouped split** against a speed-threshold baseline it must beat, **calibrated** (Brier 0.092 on ~408k held-out positions), with a **SHAP** attribution for every call. The other four behaviors are consumed from GFW's published datasets / API and carry rule-based reasons.
- **Jurisdiction + authorization.** Every incident is point-in-polygon tagged with its EEZ (the global Marine Regions set) and, where a vessel identity exists, graded against the GFW registry's RFMO authorizations.
- **Evidence.** Each incident is a structured dossier with a SHA-256 integrity hash and full provenance, downloadable as JSON.
- **Near-real-time.** An hourly GitHub Action pulls recent GFW events and streams live AIS into a rolling 12h buffer for spoofing, republishing the `?live` view and the alerts feed.

## Reproduce

```bash
uv sync                                                   # CPU-only, no GPU
uv run python -m seavigil.run                             # train + evaluate the classifier (+ SHAP)
uv run python -m seavigil.alert --scope all --sample-sar  # fishing-in-MPA + dark-fleet dossiers
uv run --group dev pytest -q                              # tests (no network)
```

Rebuild the worldwide showcase (needs the gitignored source datasets + a GFW token for authorization):

```bash
uv run --with pyogrio --with geopandas python scripts/build_eez_tag.py   # global EEZ tagging set
uv run python scripts/fetch_authorizations.py                            # GFW registry authorizations
uv run python scripts/swap_real_sar.py && uv run python -m seavigil.site # regenerate web/data
```

Run the near-real-time monitor (needs `GFW_TOKEN`; `AISSTREAM_KEY` adds live spoofing):

```bash
GFW_TOKEN=... AIS_BUFFER=data/positions/ais_buffer.csv uv run python scripts/live_monitor.py
```

Serve the site locally (Range-capable, required for the PMTiles):

```bash
python3 scripts/serve.py 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000  (and ?live)
```

## Honest caveats

- A flag is an **inspection lead**, not proof of illegal activity.
- "Fishing" is **apparent** (inferred from movement); classifier metrics are on **unseen vessels**, and the labels cover a few gear types (2012-2015).
- AIS is blind to the **~75% of industrial vessels that don't broadcast** (the dark fleet) and is spoofable; SAR sees them but carries no identity.
- National EEZ fishing **licences are not public**, so an empty authorization record means "no public record", not proof of illegality.
- The near-real-time feed has a **~3-4 day lag** (GFW events), and the showcase is an **illustrative curated sample**, not global live coverage.
