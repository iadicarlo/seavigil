"""Fold our own Sentinel-1 SAR vessel detections into SeaVigil.

Input is the detections CSV produced by notebooks/sentinel1_vessel_detection.ipynb (the
open Allen Institute detector). For each detection we tag its EEZ and reserve, attach the
SAR vessel attributes (length, heading, speed, fishing-vessel class), optionally flag the
ones with no AIS broadcast as DARK, add an evidence hash, and write a ?sar view
(web/data/sar). The detections reuse the existing dark_vessel_sar marker and dossier.

    uv run python scripts/sar_detections_to_incidents.py --detections seavigil_detections.csv
    uv run python scripts/sar_detections_to_incidents.py --detections d.csv --ais positions.csv

This is our own detection (we chose the scene and ran the model), unlike the consumed GFW
SAR. A SAR blip carries no identity, so each record is an inspection lead, not proof.
