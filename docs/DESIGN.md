# SeaVigil - design sketch

_Last updated: 2026-06-25. This is the working spec: what we're building, why, what's
genuinely new, what already exists, what we implement now, and with which tools._

---

## 1. Thesis (one paragraph)

Detecting apparent fishing from vessel tracks is solved and industrialised - it is Global
Fishing Watch's (GFW) flagship product, trained on AIS labels GFW released openly. SeaVigil
does **not** re-detect. It occupies the **last-mile seam** GFW deliberately leaves to
partners: turn a fishing signal into a **per-incident, explainable dossier** that flags
**fishing inside a specific Marine Protected Area (MPA)**, and make it **run on a laptop** so
an under-resourced coastal authority can use it. The unit of value is not "a vessel is
fishing" (GFW already says that) but **"this vessel is apparently fishing inside _this_
protected area, here is the auditable reason, go inspect."**

## 2. Why - the problem and who it's for

- **Problem.** IUU fishing erodes coastal food security and marine ecosystems. MPAs are the
  main legal instrument, but monitoring whether vessels actually fish inside them is manual,
  retrospective, and locked behind tooling that low-capacity states can't run.
- **The seam.** Across the field, *detection* is crowded and *the last mile is thin*. The
  documented gaps (see §4) are: no per-position explanation, no turnkey fishing-in-MPA
  alerting, and no admissible/usable tooling for low-capacity enforcers.
- **Primary user.** A fisheries/MPA enforcement officer or a small marine NGO in a coastal
  state - someone who needs a *defensible, readable reason to send a patrol*, on a machine
  they already have.
- **Secondary users.** Researchers and advocacy groups (e.g. National Geographic Pristine
  Seas, oceans NGOs) who need auditable, reproducible evidence of pressure on specific MPAs.

## 3. What has been done (v1, in repo)

The `seavigil/` package, evaluated honestly:

- `data.py` - downloads + cleans GFW labeled AIS positions (Kroodsma et al., *Science* 2018);
  binarises fractional labels; builds stable vessel IDs.
- `features.py` - per-position, physically interpretable movement features computed
  *within each track*: speed (+ rolling mean/std), turning rate, course change, time gap,
  distance from shore/port, cyclic hour-of-day.
- `model.py` - `RandomForestClassifier` (balanced) with a **vessel-grouped `GroupShuffleSplit`**
  (no vessel in both train and test) and a **tuned speed-threshold baseline** the model must
  beat. ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1, confusion matrix.
- `explain.py` - `shap.TreeExplainer` → global ranking + a beeswarm plot + per-position local
  attributions.
- `run.py` - orchestrates the above; writes `results/metrics.json` and `results/SUMMARY.md`.
- `tests/test_pipeline.py` - offline smoke tests (cleaning rules, feature shapes, split
  invariant, baseline logic).

This reproduces **GFW's fishing-detection _target_** with a simpler, interpretable method.
It is a foundation, not the contribution.

## 4. What already exists in the world (so we don't claim it)

Verified 2026-06-25 from primary sources. **Do not pitch any of these as novel.**

| Capability | Who ships it | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Fishing classification from AIS | **GFW** flagship "apparent fishing effort" (two CNNs), open-source `vessel-classification`, trained on the **same 2018 labels we use** | globalfishingwatch.org/data |
| AIS-gap / "going dark" | **GFW** real-time `GAP` event (Welch et al., *Sci. Adv.* 2022) | GFW Events API |
| Loitering / transshipment proxy | **GFW** `LOITERING` event type | GFW Events API |
| Dark-vessel detection (satellite) | **GFW** Sentinel-1 SAR layer, ~20M detections (Paolo et al., *Nature* 2024) | nature.com s41586-023-06825-8 |
| Interactive global map | **GFW** public map, ~70k vessels | globalfishingwatch.org/map |
| Vessel identity / IUU risk | **GFW** Vessel Insights API v3 (30-40+ registries, 400k+ ships) | GFW APIs |
| Detection→prosecution last mile | **TMT, OceanMind, Skylight, Starboard** - via *human analysts*, not per-flag model explanations | tm-tracking.org |

**The one roadmap item GFW does _not_ ship turnkey:** automated *fishing-inside-a-specific-MPA*
alerting. As of the Aug-2024 Marine Manager release it is an analysis/collaboration tool with
**no real-time alerts**. _(Re-verify before any pitch - this is ~22 months old and GFW ships
fast.)_

## 5. What is genuinely new (the wedge)

**Re-verified mid-2026.** One leg of the original wedge is dead: *automated
fishing-inside-an-MPA alerting is NOT novel.* **Skylight** (Allen Institute) ships real-time
MPA-entry + dark-vessel alerts **free** to 70+ countries; **Starboard** ships it paid;
**OceanMind** as a managed service. Do not claim it. The "dark vessel in an MPA" question is
also scientifically closed (Mayorga & Sala et al., *Science* 2025). What survives, in
priority order:

1. **Per-flag (per-position) SHAP explanation _of the fishing detection itself_.** No
   dedicated IUU-fishing tool ships a per-event feature attribution for *why this position
   scored as fishing*. Skylight exposes a scalar `fishingScore` (not an attribution); Windward
   MAI Expert explains *anomalies / risk*, not the detection; GFW disclaims output as "not
   evidence" with no per-position why. **This is the defensible core** - but scope it to the
   detection and lead with "SHAP / feature attribution", not the vaguer "explanation".
2. **Offline / no-account / laptop-CPU + auditable dossier.** Every incumbent (Skylight,
   Starboard, OceanMind, GFW) is cloud/web/managed; Skylight's full version needs a vetted
   account. A sovereign, air-gappable, reproducible triage layer for a low-capacity authority
   is unoccupied.

The MPA *alert* is a commodity we **package** on top of consumed signal - not invent. The
posture is **a thin, auditable layer _on top of_ GFW-style signals**, consuming detection.

**Honest limits we state ourselves** (so we read as sober collaborators, not a hype clone):
output is an *inspection-triggering intelligence prompt*, not courtroom proof (VMS outranks
public AIS/SAR in court); AIS-only is blind to the ~75% dark fleet - consume GFW's published
SAR detections to close part of it (see §6.5). **Licensing nuance:** the training labels are
**CC BY 4.0** (commercial OK), but GFW's SAR/live-API data and WDPA boundaries are **CC BY-NC**
(non-commercial) - so *adding the dark fleet* is what binds SeaVigil to non-commercial use.

### 5.1 Re-verify before any public deploy

Load-bearing and time-sensitive - re-check before shipping (full checklist: `docs/DEPLOY.md`):
(1) Skylight still ships **no** per-event explanation (confirmed 2026-06-25); (2) **GFW IUU
Fishing Risk Insights integrates into the public map ~Oct 2026** + per-event AI agents in
trials → the gap could narrow within months; (3) **Windward MAI Expert** is drifting toward
the line (already explains IUU *risk/anomalies*) - most likely first mover, monitor; (4)
UNEP-WCMC sign-off / non-downloadable tiles for the MPA layer (biggest legal blocker - §6.5).

## 6. What we are actually implementing now (v2)

The headline gap - **MPA-overlay alerting + dossiers** - promoted from "v2 someday" to the
next thing we build. Demonstrable end-to-end on data we already have: the 2018 labeled set
carries **real lat/lon** (2012-2015), so we can show which scored fishing positions fall
inside real MPA boundaries.

### 6.1 New modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `seavigil/mpa.py` | Load MPA polygons (GeoJSON/WDPA); build a `shapely.STRtree` spatial index; assign each (lat, lon) to an MPA or `None` via point-in-polygon. |
| `seavigil/incidents.py` | Group consecutive in-MPA, model-flagged-fishing positions of one vessel into **incidents** (vessel, MPA, time span, n positions, mean fishing probability, gear). |
| `seavigil/dossier.py` | Render each incident to a **dossier**: JSON (machine) + Markdown (human), including the aggregated SHAP "why" and the model's honest caveats. |
| `seavigil/alert.py` | Entrypoint (`python -m seavigil.alert`): load → feature → score → overlay → incidents → dossiers → `results/incidents/`. |
| `data/mpa/sample_mpas.geojson` | Small bundled set of large MPAs (committed reference data) so the demo runs with no extra download. |

### 6.2 Data contract (incident record)

```json
{
  "incident_id": "galapagos_gmr__trawlers_0001",
  "mpa": {"name": "Galápagos Marine Reserve", "wdpa_id": null},
  "vessel_id": "trawlers_412...",
  "gear": "trawlers",
  "time_start_utc": "2014-03-02T01:10:00Z",
  "time_end_utc":   "2014-03-02T06:40:00Z",
  "n_positions": 33,
  "n_fishing_positions": 27,
  "mean_fishing_proba": 0.81,
  "max_fishing_proba": 0.97,
  "centroid": {"lat": -0.74, "lon": -91.1},
  "explanation": {
    "method": "mean per-position SHAP over the incident's fishing points",
    "top_drivers": [
      {"feature": "speed", "mean_value": 1.3, "mean_shap": 0.21},
      {"feature": "turning_rate", "mean_value": 14.2, "mean_shap": 0.12}
    ]
  },
  "caveats": ["apparent fishing, not proven illegal", "AIS-only; dark fleet unseen"]
}
```

### 6.3 Algorithms / decisions

- **Point-in-polygon:** `shapely.STRtree` over MPA polygons; candidate query by bounding box,
  then exact `.contains`. Vectorised over positions; O(n log m). Pure CPU, no GDAL/geopandas
  (keeps the stack light - `shapely` already a dependency).
- **Incident segmentation:** within one vessel's in-MPA, fishing-flagged points, start a new
  incident when the time gap to the previous in-MPA fishing point exceeds a threshold
  (default 6 h, reuse `features.MAX_GAP_MINUTES`) or the MPA changes.
- **Explanation aggregation:** mean per-position SHAP across the incident's fishing points →
  ranked drivers. Reuse `explain.py`'s positive-class SHAP machinery.
- **Honesty guard:** every dossier carries the model's caveats inline; the word "apparent" is
  load-bearing and stays.

### 6.4 Done since (live + your-own data)

- **`data.load_positions_file` + `alert --positions`**: score *any* AIS/VMS feed (CSV/Parquet)
  offline - the real deployment model. GFW publishes no raw AIS, so per-position scoring uses
  your own data; this is the sovereignty claim made concrete.
- **`fetch_gfw.py`**: pulls **live** GFW Sentinel-1 SAR detections (4Wings report API, token
  from `GFW_TOKEN`) for the MPA set; unmatched = dark. Matched detections carry identity
  (flag/ship/gear), so a real **flag-state** breakdown is available. Raw pulls are gitignored
  (CC BY-NC; don't redistribute in bulk). Verified live: ~6.2k detections / ~1.1k dark over 2024.

Still out of scope: prospective forecasting; small-boat optical detection; training our own
SAR classifier (re-detection trap).

### 6.5 Dark-fleet / SAR dossiers (`sar.py`)

Consume GFW's already-published Sentinel-1 SAR detections (Paolo et al., *Nature* 2024) - no
imagery, CNN, or GPU. Each detection is a point with `length_m`, `fishing_score`, and an
AIS **matched/unmatched** flag; **unmatched = dark**. They flow through the *same* `mpa.py`
overlay, but produce a **distinct dossier type**:

- **Why SHAP cannot apply here.** A SAR detection is a single radar blip with **no movement
  track and no AIS identity** - none of the per-position features (speed, turning, …) the
  RF/SHAP explain *exist* for it. This is a missing-input fact about the data source, **not**
  a retreat from explainability: AIS incidents keep their per-flag SHAP; the XAI core is
  unchanged. (If per-flag SHAP on the dark fleet were ever wanted, it requires training our
  own classifier on SAR-derived features - §6.4, later.)
- **The SAR rationale instead is attribute-based** and often *stronger* as a lead: "industrial
  length, inside a no-take MPA, **not broadcasting AIS**, fishing-score 0.9." `sar.py` emits a
  `dark_vessel_sar` dossier carrying exactly that.
- Data: `data/sar/sample_sar_detections.geojson` (synthetic, flagged) for the demo; real use
  pulls a **GFW Data Download Portal** export (point-level, with `length_m`/`fishing_score`).
  License: **CC BY-NC** (non-commercial) - see §5.

### 6.6 Static site (`site.py` + `web/`)

GitHub Pages is static and cannot call the GFW API from the browser (token in header, no CORS,
non-commercial, rate limits). Pattern = **precompute-and-ship-static**: a local/CI job runs the
pipeline and emits static GeoJSON; the browser loads only files. `site.py` converts
`results/incidents/` into `web/data/*.geojson` (incidents, tracks, summary); `web/index.html`
renders them with **MapLibre GL 5** (3D globe, dark Carto basemap, glowing AIS/SAR points,
layer toggles, jump-to-MPA, per-incident SHAP dossier) and a click-through to each dossier.
Production refresh is a GitHub Actions cron with the GFW token in Actions secrets.

**MPA boundaries (real, display-only).** The five showcase reserves use their genuine WDPA
polygons (`scripts/extract_showcase_mpas.py` reads the marine `.gdb`, simplifies, keeps the
Great Barrier Reef IUCN zones so a no-take area grades as high severity). They are shipped as
**non-extractable vector tiles** (`web/tiles/mpas.pmtiles`, built with tippecanoe), never as a
downloadable GeoJSON: the Protected Planet Terms of Use permit online display "in whole or in
part" only if the data are not downloadable and attribution links back. The full-resolution
source stays gitignored; the map carries a clickable Protected Planet credit. Citation:
*UNEP-WCMC and IUCN (2026), Protected Planet: The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)
[On-line], June 2026, Cambridge, UK: UNEP-WCMC and IUCN. www.protectedplanet.net.* This
WDPA-derived layer is non-commercial and not covered by the project license. Detection runs
offline against a coarser copy of the same polygons (`wdpa_marine_detect.geojson`, also
gitignored) for speed; AIS incidents are kept only when genuinely inside a real boundary.

## 7. Tools & dependencies (and why)

All already in `pyproject.toml` - **v2 adds no new dependency.**

| Tool | Role | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| `uv` | env + runner, Python pinned 3.12 | reproducible, fast, lockfile-backed |
| `numpy` / `pandas` | arrays / tabular | standard |
| `scikit-learn` | RandomForest + metrics | interpretable, CPU, no GPU |
| `shap` | per-flag attributions | the explanation wedge |
| `shapely>=2.0` | point-in-polygon, STRtree | lightweight geospatial, no GDAL/geopandas |
| `matplotlib` | SHAP/figures | headless `Agg` |
| `pyarrow` | parquet | fast columnar caching of scored positions |
| `pytest` / `ruff` (dev) | tests / lint | quality gate |

Deliberately **not** added: `geopandas`/`fiona`/GDAL (heavy, conflicts with "laptop"),
deep-learning frameworks (no GPU), any cloud SDK.

## 8. Build order (commit-per-step)

1. ✅ Commit v1 baseline + pytest config.
2. ✅ README rewrite (positioning), re-verified + corrected after Skylight finding.
3. ✅ This design sketch.
4. ✅ `mpa.py` + `data/mpa/sample_mpas.geojson` + tests.
5. ✅ `incidents.py` + tests.
6. ✅ `dossier.py` + tests (SHAP bounded per incident).
7. ✅ `alert.py` entrypoint wiring end-to-end + tests.
8. ✅ Run on real labeled data, commit illustrative `results/incidents/`.
9. ✅ `sar.py` dark-fleet dossiers + sample + tests (§6.5).
10. ✅ `site.py` + `web/` static MapLibre site + Pages workflow (§6.6).
11. ✅ Bring-your-own AIS scoring (`data.load_positions_file`, `alert --positions`) + tests.
12. ✅ Live GFW SAR ingestion (`fetch_gfw.py`, token) + richer SAR dossiers + tests (§6.4).
13. ✅ Dossier deepening: WDPA severity (no-take/IUCN) + boundary version, speed-baseline
    comparison, per-incident track, by-severity/by-flag stats, full dossier view in the map.
14. ✅ Real WDPA via GEE export (`scripts/wdpa_from_gee.py`) - loader already accepts WDPA keys.

## 9. How we'll know it works (evaluation)

- **Unit:** point-in-polygon correct on known in/out coordinates; incident segmentation
  splits on gap/MPA change; dossier schema validates.
- **Integration:** on the real 2012-2015 labeled set, at least one large MPA yields
  incidents whose top SHAP drivers are kinematically sensible (low speed, high turning).
- **Sanity vs. baseline:** in-MPA incidents flagged by the model but **not** by the speed
  baseline are the ones whose dossiers should read most convincingly - that's the model
  "earning its complexity" at the incident level.

## 10. Risks & honest caveats (carried into every pitch)

- **Latency:** GFW feeds run ~3 days (AIS) / ~5 days (SAR) behind; "real-time alerting" is
  aspirational. We say "near-line triage", not "live".
- **Legal:** remote-sensing-only evidence rarely sustains prosecution; output is a lead.
- **Coverage:** AIS-only ⇒ blind to ~75% dark fleet; industrial gears only (2012-2015).
- **License:** training labels are CC BY 4.0 (commercial OK); GFW SAR/API data + WDPA are
  CC BY-NC ⇒ once the dark fleet is added, SeaVigil stays a public-good / non-commercial tool.
- **Freshness:** the "GFW has no MPA alerting" and "no competitor ships per-flag explanation"
  claims are ~22 months old - **re-verify before outreach.**

## 11. Outreach mapping (capability → audience)

| Capability | GFW | NGOs (TMT, OceanMind…) | National Geographic / advocacy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per-flag SHAP explanation | "auditable layer on your API" | "explain the alerts your analysts triage" | "defensible, readable evidence" |
| Fishing-in-MPA dossiers | the synthesis you don't ship turnkey | enforcement-ready leads | "pressure on _this_ reserve, documented" |
| Laptop deployability | reaches users your stack can't | field-deployable | Global-South enforcement story |

**Approach order:** lead with shared lineage + humility (built on your data, reproduces your
target) → pivot to the three unshipped things → name the legal/latency limits yourself →
frame as non-commercial collaboration.
