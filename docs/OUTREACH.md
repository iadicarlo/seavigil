# SeaVigil - outreach pack

Drafts to reach fisheries-enforcement NGOs, marine-conservation groups, Global Fishing Watch, and
National Geographic. Sender: Isma Abdelkader Di Carlo (independent / solo). Ask: **collaboration /
feedback** (low-friction), not a sale.
Links: live map https://seavigil.org · code https://github.com/iadicarlo/seavigil
Honest framing throughout: lead with what is genuinely ours, name the limits ourselves, keep every
claim scoped, stay non-commercial.

**SeaVigil - an open, explainable, near-real-time monitor for illegal fishing, with a reason, an authorization check, and an auditable dossier for every flag.**

SeaVigil watches priority waters for illegal-fishing behavior and, for every vessel it flags, answers
the three questions the cloud platforms leave open: *why* was it flagged, *is it authorized* to be
there, and *can the record be audited*. It runs offline on a laptop (no account, no cloud), and live
at **seavigil.org** on a single renewable-powered European VPS, in four languages. Open source,
non-commercial.

**What it does.**
- **Runs its own satellite detection.** Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical vessel detection (the
  open Allen Institute / Skylight models) over the scenes and moments we choose, within hours of each
  satellite pass, and it saves a **true-color satellite photo of every detection**: a dark vessel
  stops being a dot and becomes a picture of the boat.
- **Detects live AIS behavior** from a continuous stream: apparent fishing (a calibrated,
  SHAP-explained classifier), going dark, and at-sea encounters.
- **Grades jurisdiction and authorization.** Every flag is tagged with the EEZ it sits in and, where a
  vessel identity exists, checked against the RFMO authorizations on record, so a bare "foreign"
  becomes *authorized / authorization lapsed / no authorization on record / domestic*.
- **Packages each flag as an auditable dossier:** the reason, the place and time, the satellite photo,
  a SHA-256 integrity hash, and full data provenance, downloadable as JSON.

**What is genuinely ours (and what isn't).** Detection at planetary scale is Global Fishing Watch's
work, and MPA-incursion alerting already ships free (Skylight). SeaVigil runs the same open detection
over its own scenes and adds the last mile no one ships together: the per-flag explanation, the
authorization grade against real RFMO records, the satellite photo, the auditable dossier, and an
offline, sovereign, open deployment for an authority that cannot depend on a foreign cloud login.

**Honest limits.** A flag is an *inspection lead, not courtroom proof* (encrypted VMS outranks public
AIS/SAR in fisheries law). "Fishing" is apparent, inferred from movement. AIS is blind to the ~75% of
industrial vessels that do not broadcast (the dark fleet) and is spoofable; SAR and optical see them
but carry no identity. National EEZ licences are not public, so an empty authorization record means
"no public record", not proof. Non-commercial (built on open GFW + WDPA data and open models).

**Proof points.** The fishing classifier is calibrated (**Brier 0.092** on ~408k held-out positions,
vessel-grouped split). Validated against the **CCAMLR IUU list**: of 18 listed vessels, GFW's registry
resolves 8 and SeaVigil grades all 8 as *unauthorized*. Live now at seavigil.org with the SAR and
optical detections, the satellite photos, the live AIS behaviors, and the dossiers. Code open at
github.com/iadicarlo/seavigil.

## Two-minute demo (what to walk them through)

1. **Open seavigil.org.** The map opens on the global monitor: flagged vessels worldwide, each a dot
   colored by behavior. The legend (top-left) names every type and is a live layer switch.
2. **Open `seavigil.org/?s2`** (the optical view, Galapagos) and click a **green** dot. The dossier
   opens with a **true-color satellite photo of the boat**, the reason it is flagged, the EEZ, the
   authorization status, and the integrity hash. *"This is not a blip, this is the boat."*
3. **Click an orange AIS dot.** The dossier shows the **SHAP attribution**: why this track scored as
   fishing (speed, turning, distance to shore). *"Every flag has a reason you can read."*
4. **Download the dossier (JSON).** It is the auditable evidence package, integrity hash and full
   provenance, that an officer or a journalist can verify independently.
5. **Open the About page** for the methodology, the calibration, and the cited sources (Science,
   Nature, NeurIPS), in four languages; or `?showcase` for the worldwide historical sample.

## Who to contact (shortlist)

Fisheries-enforcement NGOs that serve coastal states (best fit, would *use* it). Use **Email 2**.
- **Trygg Mat Tracking (TMT)** - technical partner to developing coastal/port/flag states, maintains
  the Combined IUU Vessel List. Contact via tm-tracking.org.
- **Stop Illegal Fishing** + the West Africa Task Force / FISH-i Africa - African IUU enforcement.
  Contact via stopillegalfishing.com.
- **Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF)** - IUU + West Africa + human rights at sea. Contact via
  ejfoundation.org (Oceans campaign).

Conservation / MPA NGOs (would champion or pilot). Use **Email 3**.
- **National Geographic Pristine Seas** - large-MPA establishment and defense (the Galapagos demo lands).
- **Marine Conservation Institute** - Marine Protection Atlas / Blue Parks, monitoring and enforcement.
- **Blue Ventures** - community marine conservation across the Global South, low-connectivity contexts.

Open-data / satellite peers (collaboration and feedback). Use **Email 1**.
- **SkyTruth** - satellite environmental monitoring, co-founded GFW. Contact via skytruth.org.
- **Global Fishing Watch** - you build on their data and the Skylight models.

For named contacts, a few minutes on each org's team page or LinkedIn beats a guessed address.
Start with **TMT** and **SkyTruth**: both are technical, mission-aligned, and used to evaluating
exactly this kind of tool.

## Email 1 - Global Fishing Watch / open-data peer (feedback / collaboration)

**Subject:** An explainable, offline triage layer built on your data and the Skylight models - your feedback?

Hi `[name]`,

I'm Isma Abdelkader Di Carlo, an independent developer. I built a small open, non-commercial tool,
SeaVigil, **on top of your work**: it trains on your open AIS labels, runs the open Allen
Institute / Skylight Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 vessel detectors over scenes I choose, and uses your
vessel-identity registry for authorization. I want to be upfront that I am not claiming to have
invented detection.

What it adds is the last mile the cloud platforms leave open: a **per-flag SHAP explanation** of why a
position scored as fishing, an **authorization grade** against the RFMO records, a **satellite photo of
each detection**, an **auditable per-incident dossier** (integrity hash + provenance), and a
**laptop-deployable, no-account, sovereign** footprint for low-capacity authorities.

I'd genuinely value your feedback: whether this is useful, whether I have framed your work fairly, and
whether there is a complementary direction worth pursuing. Live map and open code:
https://seavigil.org · https://github.com/iadicarlo/seavigil.

Thank you for making the data and the models open; none of this exists without it.

## Email 2 - Fisheries-enforcement NGO (collaboration / feedback)

**Subject:** Offline, explainable, authorization-graded fishing triage for low-capacity authorities - feedback?

Hi `[name]`,

I'm Isma Abdelkader Di Carlo, an independent developer. I've built SeaVigil, a free, non-commercial
tool that flags illegal-fishing behavior - apparent fishing, dark (non-broadcasting) vessels, going
dark, at-sea encounters - and produces a per-incident dossier with a plain, auditable reason for each
flag, an **authorization check against the RFMO records**, and a **satellite photo of the vessel**.

The deliberate difference from the cloud platforms: it runs **offline on a laptop, with no account**,
or live on a single sovereign, renewable-powered server, and it grades each foreign vessel against the
authorizations on record. It is meant for the place the well-resourced tools do not reach. Output is an
*inspection lead, not proof*, and I keep that explicit.

Given your work with coastal states, I'd really value your read: is the offline + explainable +
authorization angle useful to the partners you serve, and what would make it credible enough to pilot?
Live map + open code: https://seavigil.org · https://github.com/iadicarlo/seavigil.

Thanks for considering it,

Isma Abdelkader Di Carlo

## Email 3 - Conservation / MPA NGO / advocacy (feedback / story)

**Subject:** Making MPA enforcement auditable, offline, and visual - a Global-South angle, and your thoughts

Hi `[name]`,

I'm Isma Abdelkader Di Carlo, an independent developer. I built SeaVigil, a free, non-commercial tool
that turns vessel-movement and satellite signals into an **auditable, per-incident dossier** of
apparent fishing and dark vessels inside Marine Protected Areas and national waters, with a
**true-color satellite photo of each detection**, designed to run **offline on a laptop** so an
under-resourced authority can actually use it.

The story I think is worth telling is the **last mile**: making the *reason* a vessel was flagged
legible and defensible, putting a picture of the boat next to it, and doing it without a cloud budget.
I run my own Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 detection and have verified it inside reserves like the
Galapagos.

I'd value your perspective: whether this resonates with your conservation and enforcement work, and
whether there is a way it could support it. Live map + a short visual demo:
https://seavigil.org · https://github.com/iadicarlo/seavigil. Honest about the limits: it is an
inspection lead, not proof, and strictly non-commercial.

Warm regards,

Isma Abdelkader Di Carlo

## Before you send (gate)

1. Keep claims **scoped**: the SHAP attribution explains *the fishing detection itself*; the SAR /
   optical / behavior flags carry rule-based reasons, not SHAP. Do not imply proof of illegality.
2. Stay **non-commercial** and attribute Global Fishing Watch, the Allen Institute / Skylight, Marine
   Regions, and UNEP-WCMC / IUCN.
3. If anyone bites on a **pilot**, do a real-data demo first: their own AIS feed and a real boundary,
   out-of-sample.
4. Re-check the [README](../README.md) is current before linking it (the README and this pack drift as
   the product evolves; keep them in sync with seavigil.org).
