"""Build at-sea encounter (transshipment) dossiers from GFW's published events.

Transshipment, a fishing vessel offloading its catch to a refrigerated carrier at
sea, can launder illegally caught fish into the legal market by hiding where it was
caught. It mostly happens on the high seas to avoid port inspection, so SeaVigil
consumes Global Fishing Watch's published two-vessel encounter dataset (Miller et al.,
Frontiers in Marine Science 2018, DOI 10.3389/fmars.2018.00240; freely in their GitHub
repo, CC BY-NC) and adds the explanation + evidence layer, the same consume-not-recompute
pattern as the SAR dark fleet and the going-dark events. Only events inside a showcase
EEZ are kept; the Phoenix Islands EEZ (Western Central Pacific tuna grounds) is a real
hotspot. An encounter is apparent transshipment, an inspection lead, not proof.
