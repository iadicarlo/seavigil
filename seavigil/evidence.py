"""Auditable evidence package for an incident: provenance, integrity, reproducibility.

The downloadable dossier is the offline, court-facing half of SeaVigil's wedge. This
stamps each incident with a tamper-evident content hash over its canonical facts and
records the full data provenance (dataset, reference, version, license) so a reviewer
can (a) verify the record was not altered and (b) trace every input to its licensed
source. It never overstates: the package carries the standing "inspection lead, not
proof" disclaimer and the known limits of AIS/SAR evidence.
