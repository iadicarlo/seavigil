"""Per-position, physically interpretable movement features.

All features are computed *within each vessel track* (grouped by vessel_id,
ordered by time), so no information leaks across vessels and every feature has a
direct kinematic reading that makes a SHAP explanation meaningful.

Feature set
-----------
speed              : reported instantaneous speed over ground (knots).
speed_roll_mean    : mean speed over a small trailing window (smooths noise).
speed_roll_std     : speed variability over that window (steady vs. erratic).
turning_rate       : absolute course change per minute (deg/min); high when the
                     vessel is working a fishing pattern, low when steaming.
abs_course_change  : absolute course change to the previous point (deg), the
                     raw turn before normalizing by time.
time_gap_min       : minutes since the previous fix (AIS cadence / coverage).
distance_from_shore: meters to nearest shore (context: fishing grounds).
distance_from_port : meters to nearest port (context: transit vs. on-grounds).
hour_sin, hour_cos : cyclic encoding of local-UTC hour-of-day (diel pattern).

The window length and gap clipping are conservative defaults chosen so the
features stay interpretable rather than tuned for raw score.
