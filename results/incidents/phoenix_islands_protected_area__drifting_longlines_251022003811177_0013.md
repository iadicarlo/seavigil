# Incident `phoenix_islands_protected_area__drifting_longlines_251022003811177_0013`

- **MPA:** Phoenix Islands Protected Area
- **Severity:** HIGH (strict no-take reserve)  ·  boundary sample-approx-2024
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Phoenix Group) (Kiribati)
- **Vessel:** `drifting_longlines_251022003811177`  ·  **gear:** drifting_longlines
- **When (UTC):** 2014-12-15T06:25:57Z → 2014-12-15T08:53:04Z (2.452 h)
- **Apparent fishing:** 98 of 98 in-MPA positions; mean p=0.93, max p=0.97
- **Where:** -3.475, -170.915 (centroid)
- **Track:** 98 positions, (-3.489, -170.961) → (-3.461, -170.850)
- **Vs. speed baseline:** the trivial rule (speed < 10.7 kn) also flags 100% of these positions; the rule agrees on this slow visit, but globally the model beats the speed rule by a wide margin (PR-AUC 0.93 vs 0.40), rejecting slow non-fishing transits and catching fast working passes.

## Why this was flagged

_mean per-position SHAP (fishing class) over the incident's fishing positions (sampled 50 of 98)._

| feature | mean value | mean SHAP |
|---|---:|---:|
| `speed_roll_mean` | 3.512 | +0.182 |
| `speed` | 3.426 | +0.164 |
| `speed_roll_std` | 0.733 | +0.036 |
| `distance_from_shore` | 35579.989 | +0.027 |
| `hour_cos` | -0.420 | +0.009 |

## Could be innocent

Apparent-fishing movement can also be slow transit or drifting; the model rejects most such cases but not all.

## Caveats

- Apparent fishing inferred from AIS movement, not proven illegal fishing.
- AIS-only: blind to vessels not broadcasting AIS (~75% of industrial fishing vessels).
- MPA boundary may be approximate; verify against official WDPA limits.
- An inspection lead, not courtroom evidence.

_Apparent activity and an inspection lead, not proof of illegality. AIS and SAR evidence have known coverage gaps and spoofing risks; verify against authoritative sources before any enforcement action._
