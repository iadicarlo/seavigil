# Incident `phoenix_islands_protected_area__purse_seines_171088031194242_0000`

- **MPA:** Phoenix Islands Protected Area
- **Severity:** HIGH (strict no-take reserve)  ·  boundary sample-approx-2024
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Phoenix Group) (Kiribati)
- **Vessel:** `purse_seines_171088031194242`  ·  **gear:** purse_seines
- **When (UTC):** 2013-11-28T18:50:55Z → 2013-11-28T18:50:55Z (0.0 h)
- **Apparent fishing:** 1 of 86 in-MPA positions; mean p=0.53, max p=0.53
- **Where:** -4.364, -170.092 (centroid)
- **Track:** 86 positions, (-4.364, -170.092) → (-4.349, -170.073)
- **Vs. speed baseline:** the trivial rule (speed < 10.7 kn) also flags 100% of these positions; the rule agrees on this slow visit, but globally the model beats the speed rule by a wide margin (PR-AUC 0.93 vs 0.40), rejecting slow non-fishing transits and catching fast working passes.

## Why this was flagged

_mean per-position SHAP (fishing class) over the incident's fishing positions._

| feature | mean value | mean SHAP |
|---|---:|---:|
| `speed` | 0.400 | +0.039 |
| `distance_from_shore` | 99702.117 | +0.030 |
| `hour_sin` | -0.976 | -0.026 |
| `distance_from_port` | 248995.906 | -0.021 |
| `hour_cos` | 0.216 | -0.020 |

## Could be innocent

Apparent-fishing movement can also be slow transit or drifting; the model rejects most such cases but not all.

## Caveats

- Apparent fishing inferred from AIS movement, not proven illegal fishing.
- AIS-only: blind to vessels not broadcasting AIS (~75% of industrial fishing vessels).
- MPA boundary may be approximate; verify against official WDPA limits.
- An inspection lead, not courtroom evidence.

_Apparent activity and an inspection lead, not proof of illegality. AIS and SAR evidence have known coverage gaps and spoofing risks; verify against authoritative sources before any enforcement action._
