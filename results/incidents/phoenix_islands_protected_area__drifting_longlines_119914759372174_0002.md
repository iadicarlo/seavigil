# Incident `phoenix_islands_protected_area__drifting_longlines_119914759372174_0002`

- **MPA:** Phoenix Islands Protected Area
- **Severity:** HIGH (strict no-take reserve)  ·  boundary sample-approx-2024
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Phoenix Group) (Kiribati)
- **Vessel:** `drifting_longlines_119914759372174`  ·  **gear:** drifting_longlines
- **When (UTC):** 2014-08-19T05:46:11Z → 2014-08-20T03:52:38Z (22.108 h)
- **Apparent fishing:** 48 of 54 in-MPA positions; mean p=0.88, max p=1.00
- **Where:** -2.632, -170.982 (centroid)
- **Track:** 54 positions, (-2.619, -171.090) → (-2.554, -170.922)
- **Vs. speed baseline:** the trivial rule (speed < 10.7 kn) also flags 100% of these positions; the rule agrees on this slow visit, but globally the model beats the speed rule by a wide margin (PR-AUC 0.93 vs 0.40), rejecting slow non-fishing transits and catching fast working passes.

## Why this was flagged

_mean per-position SHAP (fishing class) over the incident's fishing positions._

| feature | mean value | mean SHAP |
|---|---:|---:|
| `speed_roll_mean` | 4.960 | +0.131 |
| `speed` | 4.635 | +0.130 |
| `distance_from_shore` | 56748.990 | +0.062 |
| `speed_roll_std` | 1.026 | +0.038 |
| `distance_from_port` | 84737.012 | +0.012 |

## Could be innocent

Apparent-fishing movement can also be slow transit or drifting; the model rejects most such cases but not all.

## Caveats

- Apparent fishing inferred from AIS movement, not proven illegal fishing.
- AIS-only: blind to vessels not broadcasting AIS (~75% of industrial fishing vessels).
- MPA boundary may be approximate; verify against official WDPA limits.
- An inspection lead, not courtroom evidence.
