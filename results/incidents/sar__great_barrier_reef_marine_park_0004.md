# Dark-vessel detection `sar__great_barrier_reef_marine_park_0004`

- **MPA:** Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
- **Severity:** LOW (multi-use protected area)  ·  boundary sample-approx-2024
- **EEZ:** Australian Exclusive Economic Zone (Australia)
- **Vessel:** (dark -- no AIS identity)  ·  **source:** SAR (dark)
- **When (UTC):** 2024-01-01T08:29:59Z
- **Length:** n/a  ·  **broadcasting AIS:** no (dark)  ·  **GFW fishing-score:** n/a (Portal-only)
- **Where:** -19.710, 148.080

## Why this was flagged

_SAR detection attributes (no AIS track or identity; not SHAP-explainable)._

- inside MPA: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
- not broadcasting AIS (dark vessel)
- satellite detections in window: 4

## Could be innocent

A radar contact with no AIS may be a vessel not required to broadcast, sea clutter, or fixed infrastructure; treat as a lead to confirm.

## Caveats

- Dark vessel: detected by satellite SAR but not broadcasting AIS.
- Not SHAP-explainable -- a SAR detection has no movement track to attribute.
- length_m and fishing_score are GFW model estimates from imagery, not ground truth.
- MPA boundary may be approximate; verify against official WDPA limits.
- An inspection lead, not courtroom evidence.
