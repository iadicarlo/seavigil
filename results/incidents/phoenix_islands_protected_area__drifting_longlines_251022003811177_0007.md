# Incident `phoenix_islands_protected_area__drifting_longlines_251022003811177_0007`

- **MPA:** Phoenix Islands Protected Area
- **Severity:** HIGH (strict no-take reserve)  ·  boundary sample-approx-2024
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Phoenix Group) (Kiribati)
- **Vessel:** `drifting_longlines_251022003811177`  ·  **gear:** drifting_longlines
- **When (UTC):** 2014-12-06T10:07:06Z → 2014-12-07T01:40:44Z (15.561 h)
- **Apparent fishing:** 308 of 312 in-MPA positions; mean p=0.84, max p=0.99
- **Where:** -3.353, -170.626 (centroid)
- **Track:** 312 positions, (-3.340, -170.690) → (-3.463, -170.920)
- **Vs. speed baseline:** the trivial rule (speed < 10.7 kn) also flags 100% of these positions; the rule agrees on this slow visit, but globally the model beats the speed rule by a wide margin (PR-AUC 0.93 vs 0.40), rejecting slow non-fishing transits and catching fast working passes.

## Why this was flagged

_mean per-position SHAP (fishing class) over the incident's fishing positions (sampled 50 of 308)._

| feature | mean value | mean SHAP |
|---|---:|---:|
| `speed_roll_mean` | 5.920 | +0.094 |
| `speed` | 5.962 | +0.072 |
| `hour_cos` | 0.045 | +0.053 |
| `distance_from_port` | 132947.247 | +0.034 |
| `distance_from_shore` | 41656.442 | +0.033 |

## Could be innocent

Apparent-fishing movement can also be slow transit or drifting; the model rejects most such cases but not all.

## Caveats

- Apparent fishing inferred from AIS movement, not proven illegal fishing.
- AIS-only: blind to vessels not broadcasting AIS (~75% of industrial fishing vessels).
- MPA boundary may be approximate; verify against official WDPA limits.
- An inspection lead, not courtroom evidence.
