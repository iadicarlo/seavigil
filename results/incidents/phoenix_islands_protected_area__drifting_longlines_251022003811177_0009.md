# Incident `phoenix_islands_protected_area__drifting_longlines_251022003811177_0009`

- **MPA:** Phoenix Islands Protected Area (WDPA 309888)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (protected area (category not reported))  ·  boundary WDPA/WD-OECM Jun2026
- **EEZ:** Phoenix Islands EEZ (Kiribati) (Kiribati)
- **Vessel:** `drifting_longlines_251022003811177`  ·  **gear:** drifting_longlines
- **When (UTC):** 2014-12-07T21:40:47Z → 2014-12-07T23:24:48Z (1.734 h)
- **Apparent fishing:** 79 of 82 in-MPA positions; mean p=0.67, max p=0.82
- **Where:** -3.322, -170.412 (centroid)
- **Track:** 82 positions, (-3.294, -170.292) → (-3.342, -170.506)
- **Vs. speed baseline:** the trivial rule (speed < 10.7 kn) also flags 100% of these positions; here the speed rule alone suffices.

## Why this was flagged

_mean per-position SHAP (fishing class) over the incident's fishing positions (sampled 50 of 79)._

| feature | mean value | mean SHAP |
|---|---:|---:|
| `hour_cos` | 0.926 | +0.073 |
| `hour_sin` | -0.341 | +0.041 |
| `distance_from_port` | 154754.615 | +0.038 |
| `distance_from_shore` | 55539.928 | +0.024 |
| `speed_roll_std` | 0.304 | +0.016 |

## Caveats

- Apparent fishing inferred from AIS movement, not proven illegal fishing.
- AIS-only: blind to vessels not broadcasting AIS (~75% of industrial fishing vessels).
- MPA boundary may be approximate; verify against official WDPA limits.
- An inspection lead, not courtroom evidence.

_Apparent activity and an inspection lead, not proof of illegality. AIS and SAR evidence have known coverage gaps and spoofing risks; verify against authoritative sources before any enforcement action._
