# Incident `phoenix_islands_protected_area__drifting_longlines_251022003811177_0002`

- **MPA:** Phoenix Islands Protected Area
- **Severity:** HIGH (strict no-take reserve)  ·  boundary sample-approx-2024
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Phoenix Group) (Kiribati)
- **Vessel:** `drifting_longlines_251022003811177`  ·  **gear:** drifting_longlines
- **When (UTC):** 2014-12-02T23:51:10Z → 2014-12-03T04:47:09Z (4.933 h)
- **Apparent fishing:** 142 of 144 in-MPA positions; mean p=0.75, max p=0.87
- **Where:** -3.970, -174.197 (centroid)
- **Track:** 144 positions, (-3.934, -174.026) → (-4.046, -173.991)
- **Vs. speed baseline:** the trivial rule (speed < 10.7 kn) also flags 100% of these positions; the rule agrees on this slow visit, but globally the model beats the speed rule by a wide margin (PR-AUC 0.93 vs 0.40), rejecting slow non-fishing transits and catching fast working passes.

## Why this was flagged

_mean per-position SHAP (fishing class) over the incident's fishing positions (sampled 50 of 142)._

| feature | mean value | mean SHAP |
|---|---:|---:|
| `hour_cos` | 0.893 | +0.091 |
| `distance_from_port` | 303895.741 | +0.075 |
| `speed_roll_mean` | 7.413 | +0.028 |
| `speed_roll_std` | 0.229 | +0.019 |
| `hour_sin` | 0.385 | +0.013 |

## Could be innocent

Apparent-fishing movement can also be slow transit or drifting; the model rejects most such cases but not all.

## Caveats

- Apparent fishing inferred from AIS movement, not proven illegal fishing.
- AIS-only: blind to vessels not broadcasting AIS (~75% of industrial fishing vessels).
- MPA boundary may be approximate; verify against official WDPA limits.
- An inspection lead, not courtroom evidence.
