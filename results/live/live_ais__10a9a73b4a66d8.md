# Incident `live_ais__10a9a73b4a66d8`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, no authorization on record)
- **EEZ:** Japanese Exclusive Economic Zone (Japan) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No authorization on record  ·  IMO 9591600
- **Vessel:** 🇨🇾 VENUS HISTORY  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-06-25T08:47:31.000Z → 2026-06-26T06:45:28.000Z
- **Gap:** 22.0 h dark, 154.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** 23.110, 128.907

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 154 nm offshore for 22 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
