# Incident `live_ais__c2c35451cf0d34`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (foreign vessel, authorization unverified)
- **EEZ:** Marshallese Exclusive Economic Zone (Marshall Islands) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No vessel identity; authorization not checkable
- **Vessel:** 🇨🇳 CFA25-06 82%  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-08-31T03:04:50.000Z → 2026-08-31T22:40:45.000Z
- **Gap:** 19.6 h dark, 63.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** 3.777, 169.537

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 63 nm offshore for 20 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
