# Incident `live_ais__feff278532d878`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, authorization lapsed)
- **EEZ:** Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone (Mauritania) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** Authorization lapsed before this date: ICCAT  ·  IMO 7409176
- **Vessel:** 🇸🇻 MONTEFRISA NUEVE  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-07-17T07:07:31.000Z → 2026-07-17T19:47:29.000Z
- **Gap:** 12.7 h dark, 106.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** 19.332, -18.593

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 106 nm offshore for 13 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
