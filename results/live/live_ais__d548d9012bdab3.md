# Incident `live_ais__d548d9012bdab3`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, no authorization on record)
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Phoenix Group) (Kiribati) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No public authorization record (check coastal state)
- **Vessel:** 🇹🇩 670000016         9V  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-07-23T07:01:14.000Z → 2026-07-23T20:38:26.000Z
- **Gap:** 13.6 h dark, 67.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** -2.918, -169.839

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 67 nm offshore for 14 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
