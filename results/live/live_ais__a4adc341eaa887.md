# Incident `live_ais__a4adc341eaa887`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, no authorization on record)
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Phoenix Group) (Kiribati) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No public authorization record (check coastal state)
- **Vessel:** 🇨🇳 SYY31-2023-01  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-08-21T09:36:46.000Z → 2026-08-21T22:12:16.000Z
- **Gap:** 12.6 h dark, 98.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** -2.165, -169.581

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 98 nm offshore for 13 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
