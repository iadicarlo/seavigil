# Incident `live_ais__86eefc6c9d9554`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, no authorization on record)
- **EEZ:** Gabonese Exclusive Economic Zone (Gabon) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No authorization on record  ·  IMO 8912986
- **Vessel:** 🇫🇷 F/V GUEOTEC  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-06-22T08:04:15.000Z → 2026-06-25T17:02:31.000Z
- **Gap:** 81.0 h dark, 52.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** -2.100, 8.337

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 52 nm offshore for 81 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
