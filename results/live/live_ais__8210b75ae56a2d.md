# Incident `live_ais__8210b75ae56a2d`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, authorization lapsed)
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Gilbert Islands) (Kiribati) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** Authorization lapsed before this date: FFA, WCPFC  ·  IMO 9765976
- **Vessel:** 🇹🇼 JIH YU NO:768  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-06-13T16:19:09.000Z → 2026-06-26T05:19:59.000Z
- **Gap:** 301.0 h dark, 143.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** -2.233, 169.048

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 143 nm offshore for 301 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
