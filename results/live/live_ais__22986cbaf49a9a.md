# Incident `live_ais__22986cbaf49a9a`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, authorization lapsed)
- **EEZ:** Micronesian Exclusive Economic Zone (Micronesia) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** Authorization lapsed before this date: FFA, WCPFC  ·  IMO 8747252
- **Vessel:** 🇹🇼 WIN FAR 636  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-06-27T07:46:58.000Z → 2026-06-27T20:37:12.000Z
- **Gap:** 12.8 h dark, 94.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** 8.228, 155.683

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 94 nm offshore for 13 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
