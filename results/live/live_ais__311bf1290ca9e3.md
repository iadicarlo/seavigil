# Incident `live_ais__311bf1290ca9e3`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, no authorization on record)
- **EEZ:** Fijian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fiji) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No public authorization record (check coastal state)
- **Vessel:** 🇨🇳 WANGBIAO-8646  100%  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-07-07T06:29:42.000Z → 2026-07-07T23:05:13.000Z
- **Gap:** 16.6 h dark, 130.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** -19.714, 175.068

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 130 nm offshore for 17 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- IUU match is by name only; IUU vessels reuse names, so confirm the identity.
- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
