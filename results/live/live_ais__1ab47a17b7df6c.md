# Incident `live_ais__1ab47a17b7df6c`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, no authorization on record)
- **EEZ:** Cape Verdean Exclusive Economic Zone (Cape Verde) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No authorization on record
- **Vessel:** 🇪🇸 F/V ALBACORA QUINCE  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-06-21T05:23:06.000Z → 2026-06-26T18:29:13.000Z
- **Gap:** 133.1 h dark, 350.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** 12.087, -26.014

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 350 nm offshore for 133 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
