# Incident `live_ais__24fc4cad75ed2a`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** HIGH (foreign vessel, authorization lapsed)
- **EEZ:** Solomon Islands Exclusive Economic Zone (Solomon Islands) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** Authorization lapsed before this date: FFA, WCPFC  ·  IMO 9910040
- **Vessel:** 🇨🇳 ZHONG SHUI 797  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-06-23T08:27:39.000Z → 2026-06-26T15:30:57.000Z
- **Gap:** 79.1 h dark, 87.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** -13.238, 169.352

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 87 nm offshore for 79 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
