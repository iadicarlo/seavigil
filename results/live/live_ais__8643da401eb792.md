# Incident `live_ais__8643da401eb792`

- **MPA:** AIS disabling (going dark)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (foreign vessel, authorization unverified)
- **EEZ:** Kiribati Exclusive Economic Zone (Line Group) (Kiribati) -- FOREIGN-flagged vessel
- **Authorization:** No vessel identity; authorization not checkable
- **Vessel:** 🇦🇴 AB6-3-93%  ·  **signal:** AIS gap
- **When (UTC):** 2026-09-18T23:14:06.000Z → 2026-09-19T13:57:17.000Z
- **Gap:** 14.7 h dark, 126.0 nm offshore
- **Where:** -3.066, -154.308

## Why this was flagged

_GFW Events gaps dataset (satellite AIS).._

- went dark 126 nm offshore for 15 h
- satellite-confirmed AIS gap (GFW Events)

## Could be innocent

Going dark is frequently benign: in open water, where gaps are commonly protecting a fishing ground or waiting out weather. It is most actionable inside or beside a closed zone.

## Caveats

- AIS gaps can be reception loss, not always intentional disabling.
- The position is where AIS dropped; the path while dark is unknown.
- An inspection lead from GFW Events, not proof of illegal activity.
